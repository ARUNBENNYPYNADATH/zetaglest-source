4 new tactical scenarios were added / Thanks @ [Julie Marchant](https://github.com/onpon4)

* Witches' Hunt
* Native Unrest
* Warlock Overlords
* Death Road

[#13](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/issues/13)
Observers no longer take up slots on a map. For instance, a map being
played by 4 players can have a 5th person observing; a map being played
by 8 people can have a 9th person observing. Up to 10 people can
connect, which mean you can have up to 6 observers with a 4-player map,
and 2 with an 8-player map.

There are some details to be worked out, but this feature seems to be
stable during testing. See the ticket (link above) for more
information.
